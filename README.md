# image-color-analyzer

A reusable PHP library that loads a PNG or JPEG image from a file handle, stream,
or path, crops the surrounding near-white background, clusters the remaining
colors, and reports each principal print color with its coverage percentage.

> **Status: scaffold.** The frozen contracts, foundation (raster, color
> conversion, source handling), test harness, and CI are in place. The four
> algorithmic modules are stubbed and owned per developer — see below.

## Requirements
- PHP >= 8.2 with `ext-gd` (8.4+ recommended)
- Optional `ext-imagick` (enables the Imagick loader for CMYK/large images)

## Install
```
composer install
```

## Usage
```php
use ImageColorAnalyzer\PublicAPI\AnalyzerFactory;

$analyzer = AnalyzerFactory::createDefault();

// From a path:
$colors = $analyzer->analyze('/path/to/image.png');

// From a file handle (as the assignment requires):
$handle = fopen('/path/to/image.jpg', 'rb');
echo $analyzer->analyzeAsJson($handle);
fclose($handle);
```

Example output:
```json
[
  { "color": "#FF0000", "coverage_percent": 42.5 },
  { "color": "#0000FF", "coverage_percent": 31.2 },
  { "color": "#00FF00", "coverage_percent": 26.3 }
]
```

Tune behavior via `AnalyzerOptions` (crop tolerance, cluster count, seed, etc.).

## Project layout
```
src/
  Contracts/              # frozen interfaces + DTOs (Dev A)
  Options/                # CropOptions, ClusterOptions, AnalyzerOptions (Dev A)

```

## Ownership
- **Developer A** — contracts, options, exceptions, image loading, color space, test support.
- **Developer B** — `WhiteBackgroundCropper` (implement `crop()`).
- **Developer C** — `ColorClusterer` + `CoverageCalculator` + examples/docs.

Each stub throws `NotImplementedException` and has a `TODO(owner)` with the intended
algorithm; matching tests are marked incomplete. See `docs/` for the frozen
contracts and the architecture decision records, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the
Git workflow.

## Development
```
composer cs && composer stan && composer test
```
